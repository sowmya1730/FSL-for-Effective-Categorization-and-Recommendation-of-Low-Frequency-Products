# Few-shot learning for Effective Product Categorization and Recommendation üîç

üìö **Project Overview**
=========================
E-commerce platforms like Amazon host vast product catalogs, but low-frequency categories often lack sufficient labeled data, limiting the accuracy of traditional supervised models and hindering recommendations. To address this, our project employs Few-Shot Learning (FSL) for improved categorization of low-frequency products, enabling models to generalize with minimal labeled examples. Complementing this, we integrate Contextualized Late Interaction over BERT (ColBERT) with session-based and product-specific features to enhance recommendations. This dual approach improves categorization and recommendation accuracy while ensuring computational efficiency, ultimately boosting user satisfaction.

**Objectives**
=========================
- **Improve Categorization Accuracy:** Using Few-Shot Learning techniques, we aim to enhance the categorization of products in low-frequency categories, allowing the model to learn effectively from minimal labeled examples.

- **Enhanced Recommendations:** Our goal is to design a ranking and recommendation system that efficiently suggests low-frequency products using ColBERT, evaluated against standard benchmarks like MRR@100 to measure relevance.

- **Comparison to Baselines:** To validate the efficacy of our approach, we will compare our model‚Äôs performance with existing baseline models on accuracy, efficiency, and relevance metrics.

**Approach**
=========================
- **Dataset and Preprocessing:** We use the Amazon M2 dataset, focusing specifically on low-frequency product categories. Initial steps include exploratory data analysis (EDA) and extensive preprocessing, such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, tokenization, and feature extraction.

- **Few-Shot Learning Model Development:** To classify low-frequency products, we will fine-tune a GPT-based model using few-shot learning techniques, enriched by contrastive learning and meta-learning. This approach allows the model to adapt to new categories quickly and distinguish between similar categories, creating a robust classifier for underrepresented products.

- **Custom Ranking System:** Post-categorization, we employ ColBERT for ranking, with feature engineering to capture session-specific and item-specific characteristics. By leveraging ColBERT, we enable more accurate recommendations of low-frequency products based on contextual interaction. We also incorporate XGBoost for shallow ranking, providing a blend of deep and shallow learning techniques for efficient recommendation.

- **Evaluation:** The models will be evaluated based on MRR@100 and runtime, with the aim of outperforming baseline models such as CatBoost Fusion and MGTV-REC, as shown in our anticipated results.

**Expected Results**
=========================
We anticipate that our approach, combining Few-Shot Learning for categorization with ColBERT for recommendation, will yield a high MRR@100, indicating effective recommendations for low-frequency products. The results are expected to demonstrate the advantages of Few-Shot Learning in handling data scarcity and ColBERT‚Äôs potential in delivering accurate, session-based recommendations for niche categories in e-commerce.

This project presents a scalable solution for low-frequency product recommendation in e-commerce, advancing beyond traditional approaches to meet the nuanced needs of users engaging with less common, niche items.
