1. most methods are failing so we will take a smaller version of the data and try to implement a basic algorithm
2. take this smaller version and build a basic recommender system with no categorization
3. if successful apply on the larger dataset
4 if successful try categorization then recommendation

some problems being faced include

        program running forever
        how to effectively, preprocess and implement an algorithm, this is a challenge because different algorithms and techniques requires
        different preprocessing
